    Germany, Belgium and Uruguay fall at first hurdle
</h1>
<h2> 
    We lost three huge tournament names at the very first hurdle when the group stage concluded. Germany, Belgium and Uruguay were all teams expected to progress from the groups and were teams tipped to go potentially quite deep into the tournament, but for one reason or another they didn’t quite live up to potential.
Germany finally got a win on the board in their final group game against Costa Rica. Kai Havertz was the star man in their 4-2 victory at Al Bayt, but it wasn’t enough for the Germans after Spain lost 2-1 to Japan in the group’s other final game. This was enough for Japan to win the group and knock Germany out at this stage for the second World Cup in a row.
On Friday, Uruguay found themselves in a similar situation to Germany. In their final group game, vs Ghana, they found themselves 2-0 up with 10 minutes of the game left to go. But then, in the group’s other game, Korea Republic took a shock late lead against Portugal, putting them above Uruguay in the group on goal difference. This meant that despite already being in the lead, Uruguay needed to score another goal to qualify for the next round. Despite crafting a few chances, the South Americans fell short and the team tipped to be the tournament’s ‘dark horse’ by many were knocked out at the expense of Korea.
This World Cup was viewed as the last chance at glory for Belgium’s ‘golden generation’. Some of their preparations were hindered by injuries to their star striker, Romelu Lukaku. But in a group containing Morocco, Croatia and Canada, the other talent at their disposal should’ve been more than enough to earn them passage through to the knockouts. Instead, a shock loss to Morocco in game two put them in serious trouble and needing to beat Croatia in the final game.
The return of Lukaku for this game was a huge boost, and with the game goalless at half-time he was subbed on in the hunt for a goal. Maybe he was lacking some match sharpness, but the headlines from the second half was the Inter Milan forward missing a catalogue of huge chances that would’ve been the important goal to take Belgium through. The reality is a team of their quality shouldn’t have found themselves in a position of relying on those late chances, but they will certainly haunt Lukaku for a long time.
